    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, resulting in faster execution for larger inputs.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses to execute based on the input size. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' is the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> focuses on how the memory requirements grow as the input size increases.</p>
